However, most of the proteins don&amp;rsquo;t have a specific or unique structure, and this doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean a lack of function. This makes IDPs incredibly interesting. The formation of protein-protein interactions is the basis of how proteins evolve for different functions.

Currently I am working in a startup company called Fermify GmbH for the production of cheese protein production via fermentation in Vienna, Austria.
My current topic is the study of the protein-protein interaction of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) using molecular dynamics (MD).</description></item></channel></rss>

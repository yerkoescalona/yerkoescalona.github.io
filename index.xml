&lt;p>Most of the knowledge associated with proteins is about structured proteins with a specific function. However, most of the proteins don&amp;rsquo;t have a specific or unique structure, and this doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean a lack of function. This makes IDPs incredibly interesting. The formation of protein-protein interactions is the basis of how proteins evolve for different functions.&lt;/p>

My educational journey has been a significant part of my life. I started my academic path by studying biotechnology at the University of Chile, where I specialized in Structural and Computational Biology. Later, I earned a doctoral degree at the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences Vienna (BOKU), focusing on Molecular Dynamics, Data Sciences, and Python Development.
Now, I work as a Data Engineer at Novasign, where I play a crucial role in bridging the consulting and development teams.</description></item><item><title/><link>/publications/publications/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/publications/publications/</guid><description>SOM research Escalona, Yerko, Drazen Petrov, and Chris Oostenbrink. 2023. “Exploring the Macroscopic Properties of Humic Substances using Modeling and Molecular Simulations [accepted].” Agronomy MDPI, 2023.

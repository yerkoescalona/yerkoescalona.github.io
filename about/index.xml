My educational journey has been a significant part of my life. I started my academic path by studying biotechnology at the University of Chile, where I specialized in Structural and Computational Biology. Later, I earned a doctoral degree at the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences Vienna (BOKU), focusing on Molecular Dynamics, Data Sciences, and Python Development.
Now, I work as a Data Engineer at Novasign, where I play a crucial role in bridging the consulting and development teams.</description></item></channel></rss>

# Short bio

I am a computational biologist in molecular dynamics of condensed phase organic compounds, mainly proteins.
Currently, I am looking for a job as Computational Biologist, Computational Chemist or Data Scientist. 

My current topic is the study of the protein-protein interaction of intrinsically disordered proteins ([IDPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsically_disordered_proteins)) using molecular dynamics ([MD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics)).

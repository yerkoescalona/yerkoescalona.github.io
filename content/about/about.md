# Short bio

I am a computational biologist in molecular dynamics of condensed phase organic compounds, mainly proteins.
Currently I am working in a startup company called [Fermify GmbH](https://www.fermify.org/) for the production of cheese protein production via fermentation  in Vienna, Austria.

My current topic is the study of the protein-protein interaction of intrinsically disordered proteins ([IDPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsically_disordered_proteins)) using molecular dynamics ([MD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics)).

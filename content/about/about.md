# Short bio

Hello, I am Yerko Escalona.

My educational journey has been a significant part of my life. I started my academic path by studying biotechnology at the [University of Chile](https://ciencias.uchile.cl/), where I specialized in Structural and Computational Biology. Later, I earned a doctoral degree at the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences Vienna ([BOKU](https://boku.ac.at/en/)), focusing on Molecular Dynamics, Data Sciences, and Python Development.

Now, I work as a Data Engineer at [Novasign](https://www.novasign.at/), where I play a crucial role in bridging the consulting and development teams. Here, I get to apply my diverse set of skills to innovate and collaborate effectively on diverse biotechnological projects.
